ScalaFX-Tutorials
=================

Examples of using ScalaFX. Each example is a stand-alone complete project

* [__hello-sbt__](hello-sbt): 
   a basic example of using [Simple-Build-Tool](http://www.scala-sbt.org/) (SBT) and
   [ScalaFX](http://scalafx.org). Detailed description can be found in the blog post
   ["Getting Started with ScalaFX: Compile and Run"](http://codingonthestaircase.wordpress.com/2013/05/17/getting-started-with-scalafx-compile-and-run-2/).

* [__event-filters__](event-filters):
   demonstrates use of ScalaFX Event Filter API. The code is based on JavaFX example
   [Handling JavaFX Events, Part 3 Working with Event Filters](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/2/events/filters.htm).

* [__molecule-3d__](molecule-3d):
   ScalaFX 8 example of using 3D graphics. Based on tutorial
   [Getting Started with JavaFX 3D Graphics](http://docs.oracle.com/javafx/8/3d_graphics/jfxpub-3d_graphics.htm)
   by Cindy Castillo and John Yoon.

* [__sam_event_handlers__](sam_event_handlers):
  Scala 2.11 provides for Java8-like support for using lambdas in places of interfaces with a Single Abstract Method (SAM). The example shows required compiler options and use with ScalaFX.

* [__scalafxml-example__](scalafxml-example):
   demonstrates use of FXML with ScalaFX using [ScalaFXML](https://github.com/vigoo/scalafxml)
   library.

* [__splash-demo__](splash-demo): Displays a splash stage with a progress bar during startup then opens main application stage.

* [__stand-alone-dialog__](stand-alone-dialog):
   shows how to display a ScalaFX dialog (stage) without using JFXApp. You can use this approach,
   for instance, to show a JavaFX dialog from a command line or from a Swing application.
